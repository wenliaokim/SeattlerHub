# SeattlerHub is a housing recommendation app that provides suggestions for users on where to live in Seattle. To achieve differentiation with other house listing apps, instead of focusing on housingâ€™s quality, we focus more on the neighborhood environment, such as security levels, restaurants, schools or other entertainment nearby. We planned to filter houses based on those key aspects.
